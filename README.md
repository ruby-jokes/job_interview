# Job Interview

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ruby-jokes/job_interview.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ruby-jokes/job_interview)

## SYNOPSIS

Let's face it. Programming job interviews can be annoying. And sometimes the questions require you to actually think. With Job Interview, most programming interview questions can be answered in 3 lines of Ruby.

## USAGE

```ruby
require 'job_interview'
@answer = JobInterview::Answer.new

@answer.fizz_buzz(5)
 => [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz"]

@answer.fib(10)
 => [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]

@answer.quine(__FILE__)
 => "@answer.quine(__FILE__)"

@answer.primes(10)
 => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
```

Now, job_interview will help you answer non-technical interview questions as well! Simply call the appropriate method, and a randomly constructed answer will pop out.

```ruby
include JobInterview::Questions
```

Q. Where do you see yourself in five years?

```ruby
in_5_years

 => "I'd like to have made someone else rich with my re-contextualized non-volatile open architecture."
```

Q. Why are you leaving your current position?

```ruby
leaving_current

 => "I'm seeking to optimize extensible applications."
```

Q.  Why are manhole covers round?

```ruby
manhole_cover

 => "Because Reuleaux Triangles are hard to manufacture."
```

Q.  What is you greatest weakness?

```ruby
greatest_weakness

 => "I always fail so rarely so I make too much money."
```

Q. Why do you want to work here?

```ruby
why_here

 => "Your company has revolutionized seamless next generation interface."
```

Q. Does P = NP?

```ruby
p_equals_np

 => "I doubt it, but it would make life easier for traveling salesmen."
```

Q. Please tell us, in a few words, about what interests you?

```ruby
what_interest

 => "I have a special interest in modular mobile startup platforms."
```

## FAQ

  Q. Why would you even do this?

  A. We wanted to hack on something trivial and silly at BohConf 2012. Also, most job interviews are dumb, and we felt the need to point this out.

  Q. Do you expect this of be of any use to anyone, ever?

  A. No.

  Q. So what's next?

  A. The Ruby implementation of job_interview is pretty decent at this point, we think. But maybe you're not applying for a Ruby job. So a Clojure implementation seems likely, possibly to be followed by JavaScript.

## How do I get it?

## CONTRIBUTING

Really? You have that much time on your hands? Awesome!

Two guidelines, though:

- Please include a test for any patches you submit. Job interviews are Serious Business, and we need to make sure the code is correct.
- We're not that into adding more questions to `JobInterview::Questions`. So please don't target that module unless you're certain your patch is SUPER funny.
